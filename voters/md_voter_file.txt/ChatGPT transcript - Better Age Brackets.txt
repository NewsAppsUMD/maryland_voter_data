write this code in python, but more efficiently:

Sure! Please share the code you'd like me to optimize.







You said:
df['age_bracket'] = None
for i in range(len(df)):
    df['age_bracket'][i] = "18-24" if df["age"][i] <= 24 else "25-34" if df["age"][i] <= 34 else "35-50" if df["age"][i] <= 50 else "51-64" if df["age"][i] <= 64 else "65+"

You can make this code more efficient by using pandas' apply function, which eliminates the need for a loop and improves performance. Hereâ€™s the optimized version:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'age': [22, 29, 45, 60, 70]})

# Efficiently assigning age brackets using apply
df['age_bracket'] = df['age'].apply(lambda x: 
    "18-24" if x <= 24 else 
    "25-34" if x <= 34 else 
    "35-50" if x <= 50 else 
    "51-64" if x <= 64 else 
    "65+")

print(df)
This approach is more efficient because it leverages vectorized operations instead of iterating through the DataFrame manually.
