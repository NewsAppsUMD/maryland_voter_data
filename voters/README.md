We would like to group voters by ZIP Code/city, age, and political affiliation - and figure out what proportion of voters are associated with a party based on ZIP Code/city and age. We are trying to decide whether to use ZIP Code or city name - if we use city name, we run into issues with people miswriting their city. If we use ZIP Code, we may overgeneralize a person's location (some people's ZIP codes might be for two or more cities.)

Ideas for the final product: we can have a map with pins for different cities. Each city would have its own page showcasing a breakdown of political affiliation overall, and split by age.
