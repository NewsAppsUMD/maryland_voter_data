Look at registration numbers by county. 

Thinking about the total numbers for registration every fours years.


We have statewide elections in off years, every 2 years. The patterns other states see we may not see here.

The state parties remain the same, but the new parties always come and go.

The columns will be Democrat, Republicans, Unaffiliated, maybe Libertarian, and a others category.
