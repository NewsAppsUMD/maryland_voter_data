Ideas We Have: 
1) Reporting on the number of inactive voters across counties, and whether the number of inactive voters has increased or decreased over different years. Has anything encouraged/discouraged voter turnout? What is the engagement of eligible voters? 
- We could have a newsapp that let's users put filters in exploring data on voter counties/turnout. The newsapp could also feature a chloropleth map that darkens counties with higher voter turnout. 
2) Exploring voter turnout among parties during different elections. 
3) "How Maryland voters prefer to cast their votes" Looking into how different Maryland voters will cast their votes, whether its by mail or in person. Does this differ by counties or does this differ over the years? 


First Steps: 
1) Convert all of our Excel files to CSV files 
- Datasets we need: Official by Party and County, InActive Voters, Eligible Active Voters by County 
2. Putting these datasette to see how we can view the intersection of these databases. 
3) Narrowing the scope of our story and finding the questions we want to answer. 

Other Thoughts: 
We are leaning towards investigating inactive voters across different counties. Our main first step would just be to use the percent change formula across different counties' inactive voters.
